Speedo - Network Speed Monitor
=============================================================================

Speedo is an extremely small app that shows the network speed as an icon in the status bar.

It does one thing and aims to do it well without any excessive bloat. Speedo has a minimal memory footprint and is primarily active while the screen is on.
